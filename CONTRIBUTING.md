## Getting Started

If you haven't already, install [Git and Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Git Tower](https://git-tower.com) onto your local machine.

Before getting started with Git, it's best to read up and learn the basic commands, workflow, conventions, and etiquette. These resources are great for starting off:

* [GitHub Crash Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-crash-course/)
* [GitHub SSH Key Generation Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
