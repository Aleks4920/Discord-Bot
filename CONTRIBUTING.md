# Contribution Guidelines

## Welcome to Discord-Bot!
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Lakehead CS 2021 Guild's Discord-Bot project!

We wish to see your contribution to this project, no matter your skill level! This document will help walk you through getting started, setting up the Discord bot on your own server, and how you can contribute from here on out.

## Getting Started
___
If you haven't already, install [Git and Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Git Tower](https://git-tower.com) onto your local machine.

Before getting started with Git, it's best to read up and learn the basic commands, workflow, conventions, and etiquette. These resources are great for starting off:

* [GitHub Crash Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-crash-course/)
* [GitHub SSH Key Generation Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
* [Branch Naming Convention and Workflow](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848)

## List of Ways You Can Contribute
___
### Feature Requests or Bug Reports
Do you have an idea for a feature the Discord bot could use? See a bug that needs squashing? Go ahead and add it to the [Issues browser](https://github.com/Paulmski/Discord-Bot/issues).

If you are submitting a feature, title it using the convention `Feature request: Feature name` and describe what you would like the feature to do.

Should you report a bug, title it using the convention `Bug: Bug name` and describe how you encountered the bug.

### Cleaning Up Code, Refactoring
If you want to improve the project's code, make those changes in the `develop` branch or a new branch in your fork, and then make a pull request!

You can add or edit comments, clean up whitespace, and enforce conventions where fit.

### Bug Fixing
When you find and fix a bug in the code, commit and push those changes in your fork. Make sure to test the Bot's full functionality in your own environment before making a pull request to the original repo's `develop` branch.

### Adding a New Feature
If you programmed a new feature, make a pull request to push those changes into the original repo's `develop` branch.
