## Getting Started

If you haven't already, install [Git and Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and Git Tower onto your local machine.

Before getting started with Git, it's best to read up and learn the basic commands, workflow, conventions, and etiquette.
